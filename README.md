### Requirements for Contributions

This blog will accept any contribution which can be reasonably expected to improve someone's life substantially more than it worsens others' lives.

Any contribution may be excluded if it furthers a goal which conflicts with our goal of fun maximization.

We will not accept contributions which aim to promote any social hierarchy. Authority is only acceptable if it is reasonable to expect that it is backed by evidence. Authority may be used to criticize strategies, but not goals.

This blog will not accept contributions which condemn specific people or groups. It is impossible to please everyone, so we choose to displease those who would lash out against other people.

We will accept any contribution which offers a convincing argument for why these acceptance criteria should be altered.
