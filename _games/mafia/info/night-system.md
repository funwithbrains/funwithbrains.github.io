## Night System

### How to End the Night

#### Check-In

During the night, your should check in by sending the GM a private message of any kind. Even a single emote (or the Facebook Messenger thumbs-up message) is fine.

The night ends an unknown amount of time after every player has checked in and every player has submitted a full night plan.

### Night Actions

A night plan is a complete set of choices a role can make for its possible night actions.

You can submit your night plan during the day.

If you submit your night plan during the day, you can change that plan at any time before the day ends.

Once night begins, submitted night plans cannot be changed.

Night plans cannot be submitted if they are not valid.

When making a night plan, you cannot target yourself, but you can choose yourself for any non-targeted choices.
