## The Setup

Your village is aghast to find the mayor dead in the park, drained of all blood. Must be vampires! Only explanation! Panic ensues.

Every day, you vote for a player to lynch, or for No-Lynch. The No-Lynch option will not be available when a player has been killed the previous night. *(No-Lynch is available on Day 1, because apparently no one really liked the mayor.)* Each day ends when one voting option has a majority of votes, or after 72 hours pass.

Your village is without a mayor. If the day ends when there is a tie for most lynch votes, then the village will lynch one of the tied players at random.

> ### How to Vote
> 
> Vote for your lynch target by making a top-level comment on the Day post starting with "VOTE Suspect McSecretPants", except you put your target's name instead of "Suspect McSecretPants".
>
> Whenever you cast a new vote, you cancel your previous vote.
>
> If you want to cancel your vote without making a new one, start your comment with something like "UNVOTE". Your vote comments don't need to be perfect. The GM will be reading these by sight.

On an irregular basis, the GM will post a comment with a current summary of all votes up to that point, unless someone else has recently done so. If you believe there is an error in a vote summary as of the time it was posted, reply to let the one who posted it know.

As soon as an option reaches a majority of votes, you should stop commenting on that day. The GM will not count any votes after that point, and the day will end.

If a deadline arrives before you make a choice for a mandatory action, the choice will be made at random.

----

Every night, you should check in with the GM, even if you do not have any powers. The night can end after every player checks in, and no information about power roles will be leaked by the timing. If you do not check in, the night will last for 24 hours.

----

Whenever you die, no matter how you die, your role will be revealed to the town, even if you yourself didn't know it yet.

You will be able to distinguish death-by-Vampire from death-by-Slayer.

## The Factions

* Vampires
* The Village
* The Death Cult

Each of these factions is an enemy with each other faction.

----

## Vampires

### Factional Abilities

* Drain: Once per night, one of you may kill one target non-Vampire player.
* Hypnosis: Once per night, one of you may roleblock one target player.
* Dark God's Favor (usable once for every Death Cultist killed by an enemy faction): During the night, you may choose a target and choose a role. If the chosen role belongs to the chosen target, then you must use your Drain ability on that target as if you had not already used your Drain ability tonight. You will not be told how many uses of Dark God's Favor are available.
* Congregation: You have private communication with all members of your faction.
* Omen: At the start of the game, you will learn the identity of The Chosen One.

**You win when your faction comprises at least half of the village, or if nothing can stop this from happening.**

### Roles

> #### Vampires (3)
> 
> You are a Vampire! Your goal is to take over the village and drain every mortal therein. But for now, the villagers outnumber you. You will need to blend in while you thin the herd.

----

## The Village

### Factional Abilities

* Lynch: Once per day, you must lynch one player or select No Lynch. However, if a player was killed the previous night, then the No Lynch option will be banned for the day.
* Dark God's Favor (usable once for every Death Cultist killed by an enemy faction): On the next night, if the Overzealous Paladin is alive, no one can become paranoid. If the Overzealous Paladin is dead, everyone is protected from a single Vampire kill that night.

**You win when all Vampires have been eliminated, no matter the cost.**

### Roles

> ##### Villagers (3+)
>
> You are a Villager. It's your duty to make sense of the evil events unfolding around you and use your gallows for great justice! There is a chance you could be The Chosen One or the Shaman, and you just don't know it yet.

> ##### The Chosen One (1)
>
> You think you are an ordinary Villager. But in truth, you cannot be killed by Vampires! What's more, if only one Vampire survives, they cannot win without lynching you! If you are the last Villager alive when there is only one Vampire, the village wins. The Vampires and the Death Cultists already know your identity, even though you do not. If you die, everyone will learn that you were The Chosen One.
>
> * Vampire Resistance: If you would be killed by a Vampire ability, instead you are not.

> ##### Shaman (1)
>
> You think you are an ordinary Villager. That is, until you begin to hear the voices of the dead. If you die, everyone will learn that you were the Shaman.
>
> * Paranormal Awareness: You have private communication with everyone who has died.

> ##### Priest (1)
>
> You are the Priest. While you have no ability to fight off evil, you do have the skills to detect it.
>
> * Investigation: Once per night, you may investigate one target player. You will receive results in the form of "Vampire"/"Not a Vampire".
> * Paranoia Vulnerability: Be careful! If the Overzealous Paladin protects you, they will make you temporarily paranoid, and your Investigation for that night will result in "Vampire" no matter what!

> ##### Overzealous Paladin (1)
>
> You are the Paladin. While you have no ability to detect evil, you do have the skills to fight it.
>
> * Overzealous Protection: Once per night, you must protect one target player. Your target is protected from one kill by Vampires that night.
> * Contagious Paranoia: Be careful! If you protect anyone who has Paranoia Vulnerability, you make them paranoid, and their actions that night will work incorrectly!

> ##### Guard Captain (1)
>
> * Recruitment: Once per night, you may recruit another target player as a temporary Guard. This does not interfere with any other actions the target player would take.
> * Observation: Once per night, you may follow one target player. You will see who their targets are, if any, but you will not learn what actions they performed.
> * Paranoia Vulnerability: Be careful! If the Overzealous Paladin protects you, they will make you temporarily paranoid, and you will be unable to use your Recruitment that night!

> ##### Guard (temporary only)
>
> You have been recruited by the Guard Captain. This is a temporary role for one night only.
>
> * Mandatory Observation: Tonight, you must follow a target player chosen for you by the Guard Captain. You will see who your target's targets are, if any, but you will not learn what actions they performed. *(This does not interfere with any actions you take using your original role.)*

> ##### The Watcher (1)
>
> * Desperate Search: Once per night, you may investigate one target player. You will receive results in the form of "The Chosen One"/"Not The Chosen One". If your target is The Chosen One, they will learn that you contacted them, and their role will become The Slayer.
> * Paranoia Vulnerability: Be careful! If the Overzealous Paladin protects you, they will make you temporarily paranoid, and your Desperate Search for that night will result in "Not The Chosen One" no matter what!
> * Secret Meeting: You have private communication with The Slayer.

> ##### The Slayer (0 at start)
>
> You have always been The Chosen One. You have all the benefits of The Chosen One, and you can also slay vampires.
>
> * Slay Vampire: Once per night, you may kill one target player. But be careful! If your target is not a Vampire, you are overcome by grief and will die as if you were lynched â€” just what the Death Cult wants!
> * Secret Meeting: You have private communication with The Watcher.

## The Death Cult

### Factional Abilities

* Dark God's Favor: When a Death Cultist dies, every faction that is an enemy of the faction that killed the Death Cultist gains one use of their Dark God's Favor ability. Those factions will not be told that they have gained this ability.
* Dark God's Command: At the start of the game, you will learn the identity of The Chosen One. If the game has 15 or more players, you will also receive 1 false positive The Chosen One for every 2 additional players beyond 13. *(A false positive The Chosen One might have another power role.)*
* Conversion (only usable if the game starts with 15 or more players): Once per game, during the night, one of you may recruit one target non-The-Chosen-One player to your faction. That player's role does not change, and they do not leave their original faction. *(They will retain all other abilities, including abilities of their previous faction, like private chat. This is in addition to gaining access to the Death Cult factional abilities. This player can only win if The Death Cult and their original faction both win.)*
* Congregation: You have private communication with all members of your faction.

**You win only if The Chosen One is eliminated and every Death Cultist is lynched, in any order. This victory does not end the game or prevent other factions from winning.**

### Roles

> ##### Death Cultist (1)
>
> To win, you need the town to lynch The Chosen One... AND yourself! If you die in any way other than lynching, then you lose. Whether you win or lose, the rest of the town will continue its grim struggle. Other factions can still win in addition to you winning.
>
> * Ultimate Deception: Once per night, you may choose any role in the game. If you die, then your role will be revealed as the chosen role instead of the truth. *(This will not affect the outcome of investigations while you are still alive.)*
> * Friendly Chat: Once per night, you may visit one target player. This has no effect other than giving you a target.

You will receive your role in a private message from the GM.

### Other Rules

Editing or deleting posts is anti-fun. You must live with your typos for all eternity (or until the Vampires get you).

It is anti-fun to communicate about the game outside of the game.

It is anti-fun to screenshot or directly quote any private message you receive in-game. You may paraphrase, as long as you are sure you are not directly quoting. The important thing is, meta-game proof is bad for the game.

Anti-fun activities are not fun so please don't do them.

Gaemmeister Daskraw has a post with these rules and more. They all are designed to put a fun in your game so do them: https://www.facebook.com/groups/550853551913154/permalink/551256721872837/
