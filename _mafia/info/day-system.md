## Day System

### How to Vote

Vote for your lynch target by making a top-level comment on the Day post starting with "VOTE Suspect McSecretPants", except you put your target's name instead of "Suspect McSecretPants".

Whenever you cast a new vote, you cancel your previous vote.

If you want to cancel your vote without making a new one, start your comment with something like "UNVOTE".

Your votes might be counted by a GM-automation tool. If you want to be sure your vote is counted, please be sure it follows these guidelines.

----

On an irregular basis, the GM will post a comment with a current summary of all votes up to that point, unless someone else has recently done so. If you believe there is an error in a vote summary as of the time it was posted, reply to let the one who posted it know.

----

### When the Day Ends

When the day ends, please stop all commenting on the current day, even if the GM is not currently available to close the day. As soon as the conditions are met to end the day, it is already too late to change votes.

----

### How to End the Day

Different games can use different systems to end the day.

----

#### Deadline

The day ends after a certain amount of time passes.

##### Examples

> 48-Hour Deadline

----

#### Majority Close

The day ends when one voting option has a majority of votes. The day ends immediately when this happens. This rule allows the activity known as "hammering".

----

#### Delayed Majority Close

The day ends when one voting option has held a majority of votes for a given amount of time.

Before those that time passes, you may cancel or change your vote. If any changed vote breaks the majority, the timer is reset. Once the timer runs out, everyone should stop commenting. The GM will not count any votes after that point, and the day will end.

##### Examples

> 2-Hour Delayed Majority Close: The day ends after a majority lasts for 2 hours.

----

#### Combination

Two different conditions can cause the day to end.

##### Examples

> 2-Hour Delayed Majority Close, 72-Hour Deadline: The day ends after a majority lasts for 2 hours or 72 hours after the day began.

----

### Lynching Options

#### No-Lynch Available

Players can vote for No-Lynch instead of voting for a player to lynch. If No-Lynch wins, then no one is lynched.

----

#### Panic Lynch

The No-Lynch option is available, except on days where a player was killed during the night.

----

#### Random Tiebreak

If there is a tie for most votes, then one of those tied options will be selected at random.

----

#### Anti-Town Random Tiebreak

If there is a tie for most votes, then one of those tied options will be selected in such a way as to maximize harm to the town. Usually, this means that power roles will be lynched first. Next are vanilla roles. Finally scum.

If the No-Lynch option is one of the tied options, then it wins.

----

#### Multi-Lynch Tiebreak

If there is a tie for most votes, every one of those tied options will be selected.

If the No-Lynch option is one of the tied options, then it wins.

----

#### Push Lynch

You may cast a push vote instead of an ordinary vote by writing "PUSH" instead of "VOTE". A push vote has all the effects of an ordinary vote, but in addition, when one player has a majority of push votes, that player is lynched immediately, and the day ends without delay. This rule allows the activity known as "hammering".
