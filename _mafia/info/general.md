## General Systems

### What Happens When a Player Dies

When a player dies, their role is revealed publicly, normally. However, this can be altered by the following modifiers.

#### No Death Reveal

When a player dies, their role is **not** revealed publicly.

----

#### Death Reveal Interference

Something else in the rules allows for false information or no information to be revealed when a player dies.

----

### What if the game seems like it will never end?

When 3 days and nights pass with no player being eliminated, everyone loses.

This is our "Happily Ever After" rule. (Debate on this issue is explicitly invited.)
