## Night System

### How to Take Night Actions

You take actions at night by sending a night plan to your GM in a private message.

A night plan is a complete set of choices a role can make for all its possible night actions. (Your night plan must correspond to your own role, of course.)

Each night, you can submit your night plan anytime before that night ends, or during the preceeding day.

If you submit your night plan during the day, you can change that plan at any time before the day ends.

Once night begins, submitted night plans cannot be changed, *unless* the end-of-night rule makes an exception.

Night plans cannot be submitted if they are not valid.

When making a night plan, you cannot target yourself, but you can choose yourself for any non-targeted choices.

### How to End the Night

----

#### Deadline

The night ends after a certain amount of time passes.

This rule allows night plans to be changed any time before it gets close to the end of the night. "Close" here is defined according to GM discretion. You can reasonably assume your night plan will be counted if you submit it at least 2 hours before night ends.

##### Examples

> 24-Hour Deadline

----

#### Check-In

The night ends an unknown amount of time after every player has checked in and every player has submitted a full night plan.

You can check in by sending the GM a private message of any kind. Even a single emote (or the Facebook Messenger thumbs-up message) is fine.

Under this rule, night plans cannot be changed after night begins.
