## Rules

### Why rules?

The rules are only useful if they increase fun.

If you think a rule diminishes fun:

**DO** open a debate about that rule.

*DON'T* unilaterally break that rule.

Also consider that a rule might diminish your individual fun in order to increase fun for the group overall. If you think this tradeoff is undesirable, please introduce that subject to the debate.

Anti-fun events will be met with a response intended to reduce the frequency of those anti-fun events in the future. This applies in general to both rule-violations and to Game Master mistakes. It also means that players who blunder can expect to receive advice after the game is over, under the assumption that repeated blunders are anti-fun.

### What rules?

#### Editing Posts, Deleting Posts

Editing or deleting posts in-game is anti-fun. You must live with your typos for all eternity (or at least until the scum gets you).

#### Out-of-Game Communication

It is anti-fun to communicate about the game outside of the game.

Feel free to interact with other players outside the game, but do not allow the game to influence those interactions.

This means no probing for information, no secret messages, no setting up future secret messages to be found in public game comments.

This includes any communication influenced by an intent to share private game-relevant messages during later games. If you have a message about future games, please share it where all players in future games can see it. If it is advice, everyone should have access. If it is a key that can be used to decrypt your encrypted public messages later, everyone should have access.

#### Screenshots, Quotes, and Private Information

It is anti-fun to screenshot or directly quote any private message you receive in-game. You may paraphrase, as long as you are sure you are not directly quoting. The important thing is, meta-game proof is bad for the game.

Anti-fun activities are not fun so please don't do them.
