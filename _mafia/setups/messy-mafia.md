title: "Messy Mafia"
type: setup
order: 26
---

Everyone is confused! The mafia is confused. The town is confused. It's a mess.

There's a good chance that no one knows exactly which power roles are in play. Want to know what's even worse than that? Roles are not revealed upon death!

On the bright side, the mafia will collapse if only one member remains.

## The Factions

* The Mafia
  * Mafioso x3
* The Town
  * Vanilla Townie xMany
  * Bodyguard x4
  * Doctor x2
  * Tracker x2
  * Vigilante x2
  * Cop x1
  * Journalist x1

A secret number between 6 and 12 of the power roles listed for the town will be used!

The Mafia wins when their numbers equal or exceed the Town's.

The Town wins when there is at most one Mafia member, as long as the Mafia does not win at the same time.

## Assigning Roles

How the GM prepares the game:

Choose a random whole number X between 6 and 12, inclusive, uniformly distributed. Then, shuffle the list of power roles, and take the top X. Combine those with 3 Mafiosos plus however many Vanilla Townies are required to match the number of players. Sort this list of roles. Shuffle the list of players and match each player with the role in the same position in the roles list.
