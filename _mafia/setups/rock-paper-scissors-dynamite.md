# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Dynamite

Welcome to Dynamite Town!

At the end of each day, each player gets shaken once for every vote on them. Getting shaken has different effects depending on your role.

Mafia players are rock, paper, or scissors, and they gain action points when shaken. Town players, on the other hand, are dynamite, and they die when shaken too much (from exploding).

There is no lynching. During the day, you vote to allocate resources or to kill off townies.

However, there's no real advantage to killing townies. You might want to vote for townies just to avoid voting for enemy teams or your own team, in order to hide which team you yourself are on.

You cannot vote for yourself. You can vote for any player other than yourself.

If your vote is not cast at the end of the day, you are killed by a rampaging stapler.

When a player dies, everyone will be told their role and the cause of their death.

----

If you're mafia, you need to hide your identity or you'll get killed by the other mafia.

If you're a townie, you need to hide your identity or die from absorbing votes. Hiding your identity also improves your chances of killing a mafia member, helping to end the game before you get blown up.

## The Teams

* Rock Mafia
* Paper Mafia
* Scissors Mafia
* Dynamite Town

Rock is vulnerable to Paper.  
Paper is vulnerable to Scissors.  
Scissors is vulnerable to Rock.

Each mafia team will start with the same number of players as each other. If possible, the town will start with the same number of players as a mafia team, but if that is not possible, the town will start with 1, 2, or 3 more players than a mafia team.

----

## Each Mafia Team

Each mafia team has the same abilities. These teams only differ in function due to differing vulnerabilities.

### Factional Abilities

* Action: At the end of each day, your team gains 1 action point for each vote held by any of your team members.
* Determination: At the start of each night, your team gains 1 action point for each team member who has been killed since the start of the game.
* Stability: At the end of each night, if your team has more than 2 action points, your team's action points are reduced to 2.
* Communication: You share private communication with all surviving members of your team.

**You win when all members of the team vulnerable to your team have been eliminated.**

### Roles

> #### Rock/Paper/Scissors Mafioso
>
> ##### Abilities
>
> * Confrontation: Once per night, for 2 action points, you may confront one target player. If that player is vulnerable to you, they are killed. Otherwise, if that player is a Dynamite Townie, you are killed. *(Yes, you will die in a confrontation with a townie. Dynamite Townies are tough.)* Otherwise, if you are vulnerable to the target, you escape unaffected and without being noticed. *(All confrontations occur simultaneously. If multiple effects would kill a player at the same time, each type of effect will be noted in their death reveal.)*
