title: "Vampires!"
type: setup
order: 50
---

Your village is aghast to find the mayor dead in the park, drained of all blood. Must be vampires! Only explanation! Panic ensues.

Every day, you vote for a player to lynch, or for No-Lynch. The No-Lynch option will not be available when a player has been killed the previous night. *(No-Lynch is available on Day 1, because apparently no one really liked the mayor.)*

Your village is without a mayor. If the day ends when there is a tie for most lynch votes, then the vampires will use their subtle influence to determine which of the tied players gets lynched.

***Beware! The vampires are conspiring to complete an ancient evil ritual. If they can determine the role of every surviving player, the village is doomed!***

## Schedule

Days and nights will align with the days of the week.

Monday and Tuesday together are one day. Thursday and Friday together are the next day.

Wednesday alone will be a night, and Saturday and Sunday together will be the next night.

## Vampires

### Factional Abilities

* Drain: Once per night, one of you may kill one target non-Vampire player. It will be obvious that the death was caused by the Vampires.
* Hypnosis: Once per night, one of you may cancel one target player's night plan.
* Congregation: You have private communication with all members of your faction.
* Empowered Hypnosis: If the village has helped the Scions of Death to die, then the Dark God will empower your Hypnosis to help the village die. If the town has the Dark God's Favor, you may use Hypnosis twice per night.
* Blood Ritual: Once per night, you may choose any number of roles for each surviving player. If each of those players has the chosen roles and only the chosen roles, you win the game!

**If the last survivors are The Chosen One and a single Vampire, you lose. Otherwise, you win when your faction comprises at least half of the village, or if nothing can stop this from happening.**

### Roles

> #### Vampire
> 
> You are a Vampire! Your goal is to take over the village and drain every mortal therein. But for now, the villagers outnumber you. You will need to blend in while you thin the herd.

> #### Treacherous Villager 
>
> You're fed up with the human world and ready to hand it all over to the Vampires! You are a Treacherous Villager!
>
> * Awareness: You know the identities of the Vampires, although they don't know yours.
> * Outsider: You are not allowed to use any Vampire factional abilities.
> * Distraction: Once per night, you may cancel one target player's night plan.

## The Village

### Factional Abilities

* Lynch: Once per day, you must lynch one player or select No Lynch. However, if a player was killed the previous night, then the No Lynch option will be banned for the day.
* The Dark God's Favor *(active only after at least half the Scions of Death are killed by your faction)*: The Dark God is grateful for your service and wants to help you die. The Vampires will be able to use their Perfect Hypnosis ability.

**You win when all Vampires have been eliminated, no matter the cost. You also win if the last survivors are The Chosen One and a single Vampire.**

### Roles

> ##### Faithful Villager
>
> When your allies are struck down, you will take up their mantle. However, there is a chance you could instead be The Chosen One or the Shaman, and you just don't know it yet. You are a Faithful Villager!
>
> * Ascension: Whenever a Priest, Paladin, Guard, or The Watcher dies, one random Faithful Villager will lose their Faithful Villager role and take on the role of that dead player.
> * Conversion: Once per game, when a Scion of Death is killed by Vampires, one random Faithful Villager will lose their Faithful Villager role, leave the Village faction, take on the Scion of Death role, and join the Death Cult faction.

> ##### The Chosen One
>
> You think you are an ordinary Villager. But in truth, you cannot be killed by Vampires! What's more, if you are the last Villager alive when there is only one Vampire, the village wins. The Scions of Death already know your identity, even though you do not. If you die, everyone will learn that you were The Chosen One.
>
> * Vampire Resistance: If you would be killed by a Vampire ability, instead you are not.
> * Conversion Resistance: If you would be recruited to another faction, instead you are not.

> ##### Shaman
>
> You think you are an ordinary Villager. That is, until you begin to hear the voices of the dead. If you die, everyone will learn that you were the Shaman.
>
> * Paranormal Awareness: You have private communication with everyone who has died.

> ##### Priest
>
> While you have no ability to fight off evil, you do have the skills to detect it. You are the Priest!
>
> * Investigation: Once per night, you may investigate one target player. You will receive results in the form of "Vampire"/"Not a Vampire".
> * Paranoia Vulnerability: Be careful! If the Overzealous Paladin protects you, they will make you temporarily paranoid, and your Investigation for that night will result in "Vampire" no matter what!

> ##### Overzealous Paladin
>
> While you have no ability to detect evil, you do have the skills to fight it. You are the Paladin!
>
> * Overzealous Protection: Once per night, you must protect one target player. Your target is protected from one kill by Vampires that night.
> * Contagious Paranoia: Be careful! If you protect anyone who has Paranoia Vulnerability, you make them paranoid, and their actions that night will work incorrectly!

> ##### Guard
>
> You keep your eyes open at night to learn where people are going. You are a Guard!
>
> * Observation: Once per night, you may follow one target player. You will see who your target's targets are, if any, but you will not learn what actions they performed.

> ##### Apothecary
>
> You visit people at night to administer drugs. You are an Apothecary!
>
> * Treatment: Once per night, you may visit one target player. If the target is a non-Vampire and they are killed by a Vampire that night, then that Vampire will die by poisoning. *(It will be clear that this Vampire died by poisoning rather than by other methods.)* If the target is a Vampire, then you will die as if killed by the Drain ability.

> ##### The Watcher
>
> You are charged with the task of finding The Chosen One and guiding them to protect the innocent from Vampires. You are the Watcher!
>
> * Desperate Search: Once per night, you may investigate one target player. You will receive results in the form of "The Chosen One"/"Not The Chosen One". If your target is The Chosen One, they will learn that you contacted them, and they will become The Slayer in addition to their current role. *(The Slayer will still be The Chosen One, retaining each ability from that role.)*
> * Paranoia Vulnerability: Be careful! If the Overzealous Paladin protects you, they will make you temporarily paranoid, and your Desperate Search for that night will result in "Not The Chosen One" no matter what!
> * Secret Meeting: You have private communication with The Slayer.

> ##### The Slayer (none at start)
>
> You have always been The Chosen One. You have all the benefits of The Chosen One, and you can also slay vampires.
>
> * Slay: Once per night, you may kill one target player. It will be obvious that the death was caused by the Slayer.
> * Secret Meeting: You have private communication with The Watcher.

## The Death Cult

### Factional Abilities

* Dark God's Command: At the start of the game, you will learn the identity of The Chosen One.
* Conversion (only usable if the game starts with 15 or more players): Once per game, during the night, one of you may recruit one target player to your faction. *(This ability will have no effect if your target is The Chosen One.)* The target player's role does not change. *(The target player will not lose their abilities.)* If the target is a member of the Village faction, then they leave the Village faction and exclusively join the Death Cult. Otherwise, they join the Death Cult in addition to their current faction. *(In this case, they will keep the abilities of their previous faction, like private communication, if they had them. This is in addition to gaining access to the Death Cult factional abilities. This player can only win if the Death Cult and their original faction both win. The recruited player is not obligated to disclose their true role or otherwise cooperate with the Death Cult. The Death Cult is not obligated to tell this player the identity of The Chosen One.)*
* Congregation: You have private communication with all living and dead members of your faction.

**You win when The Chosen One is eliminated and more Scions of Death have been killed by the village than the number of Scions of Death currently alive, in any order. *(This victory does not end the game or prevent other factions from winning.)***

### Roles

> ##### Scion of Death
>
> You are a Scion of Death! To win, you need the village to lynch The Chosen One... AND yourself! If you die in any way other than lynching, you are likely (or guaranteed!) to lose. (You can also win if the Slayer kills you at night.) Whether you win or lose, the rest of the village will continue its grim struggle. Other factions can still win in addition to you winning.
>
> * Dark God's Favor: Whenever a faction has killed at least half of the Scions of Death in the game, that faction gains their Dark God's Favor ability, if they have one. No one will be explicitly told if anyone has gained this ability.
> * Ultimate Deception: At any time, you may choose any role in the game. If you die, then your role will be revealed as the chosen role instead of the truth. *(This will not affect the outcome of investigations while you are still alive.)*
> * Friendly Chat: Once per night, you may visit one target player. This has no effect other than giving you a target.
